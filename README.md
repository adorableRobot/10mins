# 10mins
Simple 10min timer

Inspired by research in procrastination, the intent of this timer is to create a behavioural trigger that creates a 'space of time' to get something done. Leveraging these small blocks of time that otherwise pass us by, we become more productive than we imagined.
Additionally, the timer can be used as a tool to help break down tasks that we find onerous into 10 minute blocks - the psychology of having a short window makes it easier to complete them and to feel like they aren't dragging you down. (Cleaning, anyone??)

That's the intent anyway!

But adorableRobot, can't I just use the timer that my mobile phone has? 
Of course you can! Kudos to you if that works. My idea is for those that need a 'ritual' of sorts - something special or particular to define the time. (like having a starting gun and a finish line)

What does it do?
It counts down 10 minutes.
